# Linear regression: Gradient descent
***
### Gradient descent
- a math technique
- find the lowest loss by modifing the bias and weight repeatly

#### Steps
1. Calculate the loss with the current weight and bias.
2. Determine the direction to move the weights and bias that reduce loss.
3. Move the weight and bias values a small amount in the direction that reduces loss.
4. Return to step one and repeat the process until the model can't reduce the loss any further.
